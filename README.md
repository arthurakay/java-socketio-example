# WebSocketExample

This project shows how a java client can connect to a node server running socket.io.

## Client

To run the client, select the "Main" run configuration and click the run button.  This runs src/main/java/com/sencha/ws/client/Main.java

## Server

To run the simple socket.io server:

    cd js
    npm install
    node server 3000
